Topology, often referred to as "rubber-sheet geometry," is a branch of mathematics that studies properties of space that remain invariant under continuous deformations such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. Emerging in the 18th and 19th centuries, topology's foundations were laid by problems like Euler's Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg, which led to the development of graph theory. Central to topology are concepts such as topological spaces, continuous functions, homeomorphisms, and properties like compactness and connectedness. Topology's branches include point-set topology, algebraic topology, differential topology, and geometric topology, each exploring different spatial properties. Beyond its abstract nature, topology has practical applications in physics, biology, and computer science, aiding in the understanding of complex systems and the behavior of spaces in various scientific domains.
